## Description


- As a member of a large base command asked me to create a a back end social network for the base personal to use to communicate.
- After being provided with the overall scheme of how they wanted it structured I went to work on building the models. From the models a planned out the routes I would need in a routes folder and using that as a guid built functions in my controllers folder to match the end goals. As I finished each function I checked the routes and ensured the were named the same as their functions. 
- I was successful in getting most CRUD functionality working but further trouble shooting and working with my peers is necessary to bring it to 100 percent. 
- During this project I leaned the importance of route naming conventions matching controller syntax, the importance of action in routes matching their insomnia partner, and the importance of json body ids matching their javascript counterparts.
